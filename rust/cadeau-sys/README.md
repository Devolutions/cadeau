# A dangerously unsafe cadeau to Rust

Low-level and unidiomatic bindings to Cadeau library, performance primitives and media foundation functions.

Itâ€™s possible to choose between dynamically loading the library at runtime by enabling the `dlopen` feature, or regular static / dynamic linkage at build-time.
The API itself is identical except for a `init` function which must be called before using other API when `dlopen` feature is enabled.
